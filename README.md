College Admission Agent (RAG Based)
 College admissions can be confusing for many students. There’s a lot of 
information spread across different college websites, brochures, and PDFs, and 
it's not always easy to find exactly what you need. Whether it’s course details, 
fees, eligibility, or deadlines, students often feel lost and unsure where to begin. I 
felt this gap myself, so I wanted to create a solution that makes the admission 
process simpler, faster, and more accessible using Agentic AI.
